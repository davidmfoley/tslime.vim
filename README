Simple script which allow you to send portion of a buffer to a running tmux session.

_How to use this script:_
  - map key shortcuts
    " send to tmux
    vmap <leader>ee "ry :call Send_to_Tmux(@r)<CR>
    nmap <leader>ee vip<,e>

    " change tmux pane settings
    nmap <leader>es :call Tmux_Vars()<CR>

  - In vim, select a region in visual mode and press <leader>ee (or whatever you have mapped)

  - You will be prompted to enter the session name.  You can type the name of the session directly, in this case 'my-session', or you can press <tab> to  cycle through all the tmux sessions that are currently running.

  - Next, you will be prompted for the window number, in this case 0. Like for session name, completion is available.

  - Next, you will be prompted for the pane number, in this case 0. Completion is available.

  - Once you have selected the session/window/pane once, the settings are remembered for the rest of your vim session.

  - When you'll press enter, the text you selected will be send to your interpreter.
