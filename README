Simple script which allow you to send portion of a buffer to a running tmux session.

homepage: https://github.com/davidmfoley/tslime.vim
forked from: https://github.com/kikijump/tslime.vim

Compatility: This is tested with tmux 1.6 on OSX. It probably works with other environments as well.

_How to use this script:_
  - map key shortcuts for Send_to_Tmux and Tmux_Vars functions
    " send to tmux
    vmap <leader>ee "ry :call Send_to_Tmux(@r)<CR>
    nmap <leader>ee vip<,e>

    " change tmux pane settings
    nmap <leader>es :call Tmux_Vars()<CR>

  - In vim, select a region in visual mode and press <leader>ee (or whatever you have mapped)

  - The first time you run Send_to_Tmux in a given seesion, it will ask you for the tmux destination pane:

    - You will be prompted to enter the session name.  You can type the name of the session directly, in this case 'my-session', or you can press <tab> to  cycle through all the tmux sessions that are currently running.

    - Next, you will be prompted for the window number, in this case 0. Like for session name, completion is available.

    - Next, you will be prompted for the pane number, in this case 0. Completion is available.

    - Once you have selected the session/window/pane once, the settings are remembered for the rest of your vim session.

    - The Tmux_Vars function allows changing these settings manually
